Question---What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture that enhances an organization's ability to deliver applications quickly and efficiently.

It bridges the gap between development and operations teams, ensuring seamless collaboration and automation.

For instance, consider a scenario where a security vulnerability is discovered in a popular mobile app, allowing hackers to access user data. In a traditional setup, it might take the organization 10 days to release a patch. However, with DevOps, the same update can be delivered in just 2-3 days or even hours, ensuring timely protection for users.

Real-life example:

In 2020, a critical vulnerability was discovered in the Zoom video conferencing app, allowing hackers to access user cameras and microphones. DevOps teams worked swiftly to release a patch, ensuring user safety and security within hours.
How Zoom Tackled the Vulnerability

When the vulnerability was discovered, Zoom took swift action:

Step 1: Acknowledgement: Zoom acknowledged the vulnerability and informed users.

Step 2: Investigation: They investigated the root cause of the vulnerability.

Step 3: Patch Development: Rapidly developed and tested a patch.

Step 4: Deployment: Then deployed the patch and requested users to update.

Step 5: Communication: Also they kept users regularly updated and addressed their concerns.

With DevOps: Zoom leveraged DevOps tools like continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous monitoring to develop and deploy the patch quickly.

Result: Zoom's DevOps practices enabled rapid patch development and deployment, ensuring timely protection for users.

**
Is DevOps only about delivery?**

No, DevOps is not just about delivery. It encompasses a broader scope, including:

Automation: Streamlining processes to minimize manual intervention

Maintaining code quality: Ensuring high-quality code through continuous testing and review

Monitoring: Real-time monitoring to identify and resolve issues promptly

Testing: Continuous testing to guarantee reliability and performance

DevOps is a process of improving application delivery by ensuring proper automation with maintaining code quality, continuous monitoring, and ongoing testing.

Example:

Imagine a chips factory where you want to ensure timely delivery while maintaining quality. DevOps helps achieve this by:

Automating production lines to reduce manual errors

Continuously testing and reviewing recipes to guarantee flavor and texture

Monitoring temperature and humidity levels to prevent spoilage

Conducting regular quality control checks to ensure consistency

The ultimate goal is to minimize manual intervention.

Question---Why DevOps?

Before DevOps:

10 years ago, moving an application from development to delivery took around 10 days of manual work. Many people were involved:

System administrators created servers

Build and release engineers built and prepared applications

Server admins deployed applications

The Problem:

Manual work took a long time and was prone to errors.

Enter DevOps : DevOps automated the process, making deployment faster and more efficient.

Now : Deployment takes just minutes or hours, not days!

Leaders in DevOps : Companies like Netflix and Amazon Web Services have shown the power of DevOps in revolutionizing deployment processes.
